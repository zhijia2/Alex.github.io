  <h1>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To Alex:</h1>
  <h2>(2022 24 years old)</h2>
  <h2>I always think paying a lot of attention to preparing someone's birthday gift is stupid behavior, but I want you to know you are loved by me! I hope if you can notice the love and feel safe and peaceful with my love, then this behavior is not stupid.</h2>
<h2>We had broke up so many times, maybe we will break up more in the future, maybe we will break up truly in the future; maybe we will stay in the different countries/different cities and cannot meet forever in the future. However, at this moment, Zhijia feels happy just because she is thinking about you. 'this moment' did happen, and will exist forever and will never be changed by what happened in the future.</h2>
<h2>Ideally, I will update this website every year according to the format (2xxx, 2+xxx years old). I do this out of selfishness. I hope you remember me forever. (At least when your birthday)</h2>
