  <h1>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To Alex:</h1>
  <h2>(2022 24 years old)</h2>
  <h2>I always think paying a lot of attention to preparing someone's birthday gift is stupid behavior, but I want you to know you are loved by me! I hope if you can notice the love and feel safe and peaceful with my love, then this behavior is not stupid.</h2>
<h2>We had broke up so many times, maybe we will break up more in the future, maybe we will break up truly in the future; maybe we will stay in the different countries/different cities and cannot meet forever in the future. However, at this moment, Zhijia feels happy just because she is thinking about you. 'this moment' did happen, and will exist forever and will never be changed by what happened in the future.</h2>
<h2>Ideally, I will update this website every year according to the format (2xxx, 2+xxx years old). I do this out of selfishness. I hope you remember me forever. (At least when your birthday)</h2>

 <h2>Alex, recently I always thinking, if today’s me, go back to the time we just met and fell in love, would I understand your anxiety and loneliness better and give you some support? Would I don’t see myself as a little girl need to be loved but know I am so capable of providing you the love and understanding of your need? Last year, I said even though we really broke up, at that moment, I felt happy just thinking of you. This year, I want to tell you. Babe, one day I will barely think of you. I will hardly remember you. I will forget you. However, I will keep loving you. Some part of my heart (more precisely, my brain) still wishes you could be happy, wishes you feel less pain, wishes you could figure out the things you want to figure out, wishes you could have the chance to keep learning, wishes there are some people can care about you, wishes everyone respects you, wishes you don’t care about how others see you, wishes the world disappoints you a little less.
Btw, I did have a lot of great time with you. There were a lot of moments I wanted them to keep happening and has known it’s a difficult thing. I will just keep the memory in my heart.</h2>

<h2>Not sure if I will keep updating this shitty website next year, but I won’t delete it for sure.</h2>
